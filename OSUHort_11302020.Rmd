## Background

* Use Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to study designed experiments

    * Are there *statistically significant differences* among treatment effects?

* One common problem: unequal variance / standard deviation within treatment groups

    * Focus of the talk!
    
## Accessing Slides
    
* I will interweave R code to illustrate ideas (I will also provide SAS code!)

\scriptsize

```{r}
this_is_a_function <- function(argument) {
  return(argument)
}
this_is_an_argument <- "this is output"

# ANOVA

## Experiment Roadmap 

1. Formulate a hypothesis

2. Choose an experimental design

3. Choose an analysis method

4. Randomize treatments

5. Collect data

6. Analyze data (focus of the talk)

7. Report results

## Experiment Roadmpap

* Often use ANOVA to analyze data

    * Focus on one-way ANOVA with categorical (group) structure
    
    * $Y_i = \mu + \alpha_i + \epsilon_i$
    
    * Response = True Mean + Treatment Effect + Random Error

* Several attractive propreties (accurate, precise, p-values reliable) **when assumptions are satisfied**

* One important assumption **constant variance**

    * All $\epsilon_i$ have the same variance (standard deviation)
    
    * standard deviation = $\sqrt{\text{variance}}$
    
* What about using ANOVA when the data do not have constant variance?


## Percent Green Cover Data

```{r turfgrass image, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "60%", out.height = "60%", fig.cap = "Healthy vs. Non-Healthy Turfgrass. Percent green cover is the proportion of healthy turfgrass."}
include_graphics("turfgrass.png")
```

## Percent Green Cover Data

- Use simulated data to study analysis methods

    - So helpful because we know the truth!
    
    - Study several scenarios without having to design an experiment, collect data, etc.
    
```{r}
sim_df <- data.frame(Treatment = c("Trt1", "Trt2", "Trt3", "Trt4"),
                     Mean = c(50, 50, 58, 60),
                     StDev = c(5, 2, 1, 0.5),
                     Replicates = c(8, 8, 8, 8))
kbl(sim_df, booktabs = T, caption = "Treatment Means, Standard Deviations (StDev), and Replicates") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")
```


## Percent Green Cover Data

\footnotesize

```{r}
create_data <- function(treatments, means, stdevs, replicates) {
  n <- sum(replicates)
  treatments <- factor(rep(treatments, times = replicates))
  means <- rep(means, times = replicates)
  stdevs <- rep(stdevs, times = replicates)
  sigma <- diag(stdevs^2)
  pct_green <- as.vector(means + t(chol(sigma)) %*% rnorm(n))
  data <- data.frame(treatments, pct_green)
}
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(1130)
data <- create_data(treatments = c("Trt1", "Trt2", "Trt3", "Trt4"), 
                    means = c(50, 50, 58, 60),
                    stdevs = c(5, 2, 1, 0.5),
                    replicates = c(8, 8, 8, 8))
head(data, n = 9)
```


## Visualizing the Data

* Visualization always a good first step -- notice the difference in spread!

```{r, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", out.height = "50%", fig.cap = "Percent Green Cover by Treatment Group."}
ggplot(data, aes(x = treatments, y = pct_green)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.8)  +
  labs(x = "Treatment Group",
       y = "Percent Green Cover") +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 12))
```


## ANOVA Code

* Let's perform an ANOVA

\scriptsize

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Perform the ANOVA
anova_model <- gls(pct_green ~ treatments, data = data) # nlme package
# Pairwise comparisons among treatments 
anova_trtmeans <- emmeans(anova_model, "treatments") # emmeans package
pairs(anova_trtmeans, adjust = "bonferroni") # emmeans package
```


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# SAS Code
proc mixed data=data;
  class treatments;
  model pct_green = treatments;
  lsmeans treatments / diff adjust=BON;
run;
```

## ANOVA Results

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Perform the ANOVA
anova_model <- gls(pct_green ~ treatments, data = data) # nlme package
# Pairwise Comparisons Among Treatments 
anova_trtmeans <- emmeans(anova_model, "treatments") # emmeans package
emmeans_output_anova <- pairs(anova_trtmeans, adjust = "bonferroni") # emmeans package
```

\small

```{r}
emmeans_df_anova <- as.data.frame(emmeans_output_anova)
kableExtra::kbl(
  emmeans_df_anova, 
  booktabs = T,
  caption = "ANOVA Pairwise Comparison Results. P-values have been adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method.",
  digits = 3
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped") %>%
  column_spec(3, color = spec_color(emmeans_df_anova$SE, option = "D")) %>%
  column_spec(4, color = spec_color(emmeans_df_anova$df, option = "D"))
```

## ANOVA Residuals

* Use residuals (normalized) to check assumptions!

    * Regular residuals divided by their standard deviations

```{r, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", out.height = "50%", fig.cap = "Fitted Values vs Normalized residuals Using ANOVA for Percent Green Cover"}
fitted_values <- fitted(anova_model)
residuals <- residuals(anova_model, type = "normalized")
check_anova_assumptions <- data.frame(fitted_values, residuals)
ggplot(check_anova_assumptions, aes(x = fitted_values, y = residuals)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.8) + 
  labs(x = "Fitted Values", y = "Residuals (normalized)") + 
  theme(title = element_text(size = 12))
```


* That variance does $\color{red}{\text{NOT}}$ look constant!

## Can We Trust Our Analysis?

```{r boxplot image, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "65%", out.height = "65%"}
include_graphics("trust_boxplot.png")
```

# Warning Signs?

## Warning Signs?

* Were there any warning signs?

    * $\color{red}{\text{YES}}$

* What were they?

1. Graphics

2. Ratio of largest variance and smallest variance

3. Statistical hypothesis tests for constant variance

## Graphics

* It it looks off, it probabily is!

* Similar to the spread we saw in data (should also visualize data!)

```{r, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", out.height = "50%", fig.cap = "Fitted Values vs Normalized Residuals Using ANOVA for Percent Green Cover"}
ggplot(check_anova_assumptions, aes(x = fitted_values, y = residuals)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.8)  +
  labs(x = "Treatment Group",
       y = "Percent Green Cover") +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 12))
```


## Variance Ratios

* Rule of thumb: ANOVA problems when variance ratios larger than 1.5 to 9 (seen cutoff suggestions within this range)

    * Standard deviation range of 1.22 to 3

\footnotesize

```{r, echo = TRUE}
(trt_stdevs <- data %>% 
  group_by(treatments) %>%
  summarize(grp_stdev = sd(pct_green)))
(stdev_ratio <- max(trt_stdevs$grp_stdev) / 
    min(trt_stdevs$grp_stdev))
```

## Statistical Tests for Constant Varince

* Hypothesis test constant variance assumption is questioned

    * Low p-value $\rightarrow$ evidence the variances are $\color{red}{\text{NOT}}$ equal
    
    * Levene's test, Brown-Forsythe test are two examples -- there are many others
    
    * Come with their own assumptions

\scriptsize

```{r, echo = TRUE}
leveneTest(pct_green ~ treatments, 
           center = "mean", data = data) # car package
```

## What Now?

* We know constant variance assumption is invalid -- what now?

* We could transform the response variable
    
    * Hope the transformed data has constant variance
    
* This approach can be very useful!

* But there are some drawbacks!

## What Now?


1. Generally require relationship between mean and variance to be successful
    
    * Example: Log transformations successful when mean increases $\rightarrow$ variance increases
    
2. Analysis on transformed scale -- $\color{red}{\text{NOT}}$ original scale
    
    * Statistically significant difference on transformed scale does not necessarily imply a statistically significant difference on the original scale
    
    
## Transformations

* Most common is the log$_e(Y)$ transformation -- lets hope this works!

```{r, fig.align = "center", out.width = "45%", out.height = "45%", fig.cap = "Fitted Values vs Normalized Residuals Using ANOVA for Log$_e$ Percent Green Cover"}
# Perform the ANOVA on the log percent green
loganova_model <- gls(log(pct_green) ~ treatments, data = data) # nlme package
fitted_values <- fitted(loganova_model)
residuals <- residuals(loganova_model, type = "normalized")
check_loganova_assumptions <- data.frame(fitted_values, residuals)
ggplot(check_loganova_assumptions, aes(x = fitted_values, y = residuals)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.8) + 
  labs(x = "Fitted Values", y = "Residuals (normalized)") + 
  theme(title = element_text(size = 12))

```

* Square root, cube root, reciprocal transformations don't work either -- we need another approach!

# GVANOVA

## What is GV-ANOVA?

* Can use Generalized Variance ANOVA (GV-ANOVA) to directly model variances within groups

    * Separate variance for each treatment level
    
    * No mean / variance relationship required
    
    * Analysis on original scale
    
    * More variance parameters require estimation
    
* Goal of this talk is to introduce an alternative approach to transformations

    * Important to be aware of both -- transformations are still a useful tool in the toolbox!

## GVANOVA Code

* Let's perform an GVANOVA

\scriptsize 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Perform the GVANOVA
gvanova_mod <- gls(pct_green ~ treatments, 
                   weights = varIdent(form = ~ 1 | treatments),
                   data = data) # nlme package
# Pairwise comparisons among treatments
gvanova_trtmeans <- emmeans(gvanova_mod, "treatments") # emmeans package
pairs(gvanova_trtmeans, adjust = "bonferroni") #emmeans package
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# SAS Code
proc mixed data=data;
  class treatments;
  model pct_green = treatments / ddfm=SAT; # this is different
  repeated / group = treatments; # this is different
  lsmeans treatments / diff adjust=BON;
run;
```

## GVANOVA Analysis

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Perform the GVANOVA
gvanova_model <- gls(pct_green ~ treatments, 
                   weights = varIdent(form = ~ 1|treatments),
                   data = data) # nlme package
# Pairwise comparisons among treatments
gvanova_trtmeans <- emmeans(gvanova_model, "treatments") # emmeans package
emmeans_output_gvanova <- pairs(gvanova_trtmeans, adjust = "bonferroni") #emmeans package
```

\small

```{r}
emmeans_df_gvanova <- as.data.frame(emmeans_output_gvanova)
kbl(
  emmeans_df_gvanova, 
  booktabs = T,
  caption = "GVANOVA Pairwise Comparison Output. P-values have been adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method.",
  digits = 3
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped") %>%
  column_spec(3, color = spec_color(emmeans_df_gvanova$SE, option = "D")) %>%
  column_spec(4, color = spec_color(emmeans_df_gvanova$df, option = "D"))
```


## ANOVA vs GVANOVA

```{r}
emmeans_df <- left_join(emmeans_df_anova, emmeans_df_gvanova, by = "contrast", suffix = c(".anova", ".gvanova")) %>%
  select(contrast, SE.anova, SE.gvanova, p.value.anova, p.value.gvanova) %>% 
  mutate(true.diff = c(0, -8, -10, -8, -10, -2))
kbl(
  emmeans_df, 
  booktabs = T, 
  caption = "Standard Errors and P-values of ANOVA (*.a) and GVANOVA (*.gva)",
  digits = 3,
  col.names = c("contrast", "SE.a", "SE.gva", "p.a", "p.gva", "true.diff")
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped", font_size = 12) %>%
  column_spec(2, color = spec_color(emmeans_df$SE.anova, option = "D")) %>%
  column_spec(3, color = spec_color(emmeans_df$SE.gvanova, option = "D")) %>%
  column_spec(5, color = c("red", rep("black", 4), "red"))
```

* More uncertainty refleted in `Trt1 - Trt2`

* Less uncertainty reflected in `Trt3 - Trt4`

## GVANOVA Residuals

* Use residuals (normalized) to check assumptions!

* Even spread yields evidence the GVANOVA assumptions are satisfied

```{r, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", out.height = "50%", fig.cap = "Fitted Values vs Normalized Residuals Using GVANOVA for Percent Green Cover"}
fitted_values <- fitted(gvanova_model)
residuals <- residuals(gvanova_model, type = "normalized")
check_gvanova_assumptions <- data.frame(fitted_values, residuals)
ggplot(check_gvanova_assumptions, aes(x = fitted_values, y = residuals)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.8) + 
  labs(x = "Fitted Values", y = "Residuals (normalized)") + 
  theme(title = element_text(size = 11))
```

# Takeaways

## Takeaways

* ANOVA is the best tool we have when assumptions are satisfied

* Constant variance assumption should not be overlooked

    * Remember the warning signs!

* Two approaches: transformations and GVANOVA

* When true variance is not constant, using an analysis approach accomodating this will generally yield **a more accurate representation of the truth**
